## Hi there 👋🏼

I'm Sunny. I run a little ✨ jewelry ✨ business called 🛍️ [MapleAndGinkgo](https://mapleandginkgo.etsy.com) 🛍️

Sometimes I put out jewelry in my neighborhood or around my city "for free" or "for donations". These are usually items that don't sell well, or have slight imperfections, or are on clearance. If you'd like, you can Venmo me [@MapleAndGinkgo](https://account.venmo.com/u/MapleAndGinkgo), and I usually choose one or two causes to donate to.

It's a small way to brighten the neighborhood, while also doing some good 💚

In 2023, I donated to [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/).

In 2024, I will be donating to the following nonprofits:
- [Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières)](https://www.msf.org/)
- [Palestine Children's Relief Fund](https://www.pcrf.net/)
- [United Nations Relief and Works Agency](https://www.unrwa.org/)

### Shop
You can check out my shop at [mapleandginkgo.etsy.com](https://mapleandginkgo.etsy.com). (If you plan to purchase anything, it helps me save 4% in Etsy fees if you use this link directly.)

### Social media
Technically, I do have an IG account for my small business, but I'm only active there, like, once a year. You can follow along, though, if you'd like, [@maple.ginkgo](https://www.instagram.com/maple.ginkgo/) 🙂

💚

Thanks for stopping by!
